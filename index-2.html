    <h1>👻 Ex-Orcism Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>Ex-Orcism is designed with your privacy as a priority. Here's the simple version: we don't collect your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Ex-Orcism does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers. All data you enter into the app is stored locally on your device only.</p>

    <h2>What We Store Locally</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Names you enter for ex-orcism rituals (stored in the "Graveyard" feature)</li>
        <li>Your destruction method preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device. We cannot access it, and neither can anyone else.</p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>We do not use any analytics or tracking services. We have no idea how you use the app, and we prefer it that way.</p>

    <h2>Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not share any data with third parties because we don't have any of your data to share.</p>

    <h2>Sharing Feature</h2>
    <p>The app allows you to share images of your "ex-orcism" results. When you use this feature, you are choosing to share that content through your device's native sharing capabilities. We do not have access to what you share or who you share it with.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all your data at any time by using the "Clear All" button in the Graveyard, or by deleting the app from your device.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Ex-Orcism is intended for users 13 years and older. The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>If we ever change this policy, we'll update the date at the top. But honestly, our policy is "we don't collect data," and that's unlikely to change.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions? Reach out at <a href="mailto:aleksandrhartunian@gmail.com">aleksandrhartunian@gmail.com</a></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 12px; color: #6b7280;">No exes were harmed in the making of this app.</p>
